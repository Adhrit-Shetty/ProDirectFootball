        A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. Two types of cookies are used on this website: Session Cookies - which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site Persistent cookies - which remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (although how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). Cookies can help a website to arrange content to match your preferred interests more quickly. Most major websites use cookies. Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you.
        <br><br> <b>Find out more about cookies: </b> How we use Cookies on our Site and what Information we collect. <br><br> <b>Session Cookies. </b> <br><br> To allow you to carry information across pages of our site and avoid having to re-enter information. Within registration to allow you to access stored information. To apply discounts dependant on your point of entry into the site. <br><br> <b>Persistent Cookies.</b> <br><br> To allow you to maintain a shopping basket. To help us recognise you as a unique visitor (just a number) when you return to our website and to allow us to tailor content to match your preferences. This also prevents you from having to 'Log In' every visit. The cookie cannot be read by a Web site other than the one that sent the cookie.
        <br><br> <b>Disabling/Enabling Cookies.
      </b> <br><br> You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. However, you will not be able to use all the interactive features of our site if cookies are disabled. <br><br> <b>Data Protection </b> <br><br> Pro:Direct is registered in accordance with United Kingdom Data Protection Legislation and will hold and use your personal data strictly in accordance with UK data protection legislation.
        <br><br> <b>How does Pro:Direct protect visitor information? </b> <br><br> Pro:Direct has a committed Security Policy. Pro:Direct will retain copies of the information provided when you register on the website, order any products from the site and enter into any competitions. Pro:Direct implements a number of sophisticated security measures to ensure the safety of any personal information provided. The information is contained on a secure server, which is accessible only by a limited number of employees who have authorised access rights to such information. All sensitive and credit card information supplied by any visitor to us is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
        SSL is commonly-used for managing the security of message transmission on the Internet through public-and-private key encryption and a digital certificate that establishes your credentials when doing Internet business or other on-line transactions. When you are asked to enter any personal details or credit card information the web site will be secure. This is easily identifiable by an icon in the bottom of the browser window resembling an unbroken key or a closed lock.
        SSL ensures that the information being sent is secure.
        Your card number will be encrypted and replaced by a unique transaction reference number. Pro:Direct uses online bank secure servers and does not hold any customer card details on any Pro:Direct server at any time. To remove any name and address details please see remove details section in the Pro:Direct's help menu.
        <br><br> <b>Pro:Direct's Policy for Children </b> <br><br> Pro:Direct realises and understands that many children will visit Pro Direct websites but encourages all persons under 13 to consult with their parents or legal guardian before submitting any information to this web site and indeed any other web site.
        However, Pro:Direct believes that ultimately it is the responsibility of parents or legal guardian to supervise children when online and recommend that parental control tools be put in place. No information collected from anyone under the age of 18 will be used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatever as is stated when you register for competitions or promotions. Although anyone under the age of 13 is able to participate in competitions and promotions, notification of a win or prize will be sent directly to the parent or legal guardian identified in the initial registration process. Any publication of a competition winner's personal details for visitors under 18 will require parental or legal guardian consent during registration.
